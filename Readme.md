# What's EZCP

*EZCP works like a clipboard*: you Copy something to it from machine A, and you Paste it on machine B.

It works accross the internet. Easy Copy. Hence the name.

To make sure your clipboard is private, it is associated to a Token.
You can create a new token by visiting [https://ezcp.io](https://ezcp.io).
Copy the token on the page, and you're good to go (others are shown a different token).

## Install

There are two ways to get the EZCP command line tool: Go, and Node.js.

Some prefer a single binary compiled for their platform, others like Node.js better.

### You can install the following *Go* binaries

- for linux, [https://get.ezcp.io/linux/ezcp](https://get.ezcp.io/linux/ezcp)
- for osx, [https://get.ezcp.io/osx/ezcp](https://get.ezcp.io/osx/ezcp)
- for windows, [https://get.ezcp.io/windows/ezcp](https://get.ezcp.io/windows/ezcp)

Open the link in a navigator, or use `wget` or `curl`, then copy the file somewhere 
in your path.

### Or the Node.js version

The Node.js install is even easier if you already have Node.js installed.

`npm install -g ezcp`

Then you can use the `ezcp` command.

# Using: Novice

Say you have a file you want to send from machine A to machine B.

On machine A, type `ezcp [filename] [token]`. It Copies the file's contents to the internet.

On machine B, simply type `ezcp [token] [newfile]` and ezcp will Paste the contents of the Token to `[newfile]`.

*Note:*

- Once you've Copied to a Token, you can't reuse the token to copy something else
- You have 1 hour to paste the contents of a Token
- Once you've Pasted a Token, you can't reuse it to Paste again
- You can get as many tokens as you need on [https://ezcp.io](https://ezcp.io)
- You can't use ezcp for files larger than 20MB. Use compression!
- If you loose your token, there is no way to get it back!
- When the token is gone, the file is gone from our servers too

# Using: Intermediate

Say you want to send a file to someone who doesn't have ezcp:

You can `ezcp [file] [token]` and send the person a link to `https://ezcp.io/download/[token]`. The file contents will be downloaded to his computer.

Say you want to encrypt the contents on your computer, and send it encrypted:

Use `ezcp -x passphrase [file] [token]` and `ezcp -x passphrase [token] [newfile]`. EZCP has no idea what your file contains or even its name! At all times, your files travel encrypted by SSL, but sometimes you need the extra security of a password...
We're using AES-256, and the Node.js and Go implementations are 100% compatible. Encrypt on one, decrypt on the other.

Say you need to transfer your Mongodb dump from machine A to machine B :

`mongodump | tar cfz - | ezcp [token]` will Copy your database backup on machine A.

`ezcp [token] > mongodb.backup.tgz` will transfer the backup to machine B!

and of course, you could have encrypted your backups with `mongodump | tar cfz - | ezcp [token] -x mypass` and `ezcp -x mypass [token] > mongodb.backup.tgz`.

# Using: Advanced

If you want to use ezcp in a batch scenario, you should register. It's super fast, easy, secure and anonymous.

- it provides a permanent token that can be reused and is safe for inclusion in cron jobs or in a CI/CD scenario
- you can login from as many machines as you want
- it raises the file size limit from 20MB to 150MB
- you don't need to specify the token explicitely on the command line!
- your files stay on the server for 24 hours instead of 1.

After using `ezcp -b` and `ezcp -l [transaction hash]`, you can copy files with `ezcp [filename]` and `ezcp [newfile]`.

You can pipe to ezcp with `command | ezcp` and `ezcp > newfile`.

But you can still get a transient token on [https://ezcp.io](https://ezcp.io) and use it as usual. And of course you can encrypt with AES-256 with `-x`.
